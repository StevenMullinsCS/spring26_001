//WakeySnakey Game
//
// I approached this as if I was going to take this to a design phase, spoiler alert, I am. I am going to take this game through every stage of the sdlc, as we learn about them through class. since we jsut learned about design. I am going to model the game this week, and show you, and then take it to every other step, as we go.
// Tried my best to follow SMART criteria
// made these requirements by: first, I manually made the first 28. then I gave the list to AI and asked it where my blindspots were (simulating proofreading, or having a coworker look at my work) it had some good suggestions and I wrote the remainder of the requirements from those.
//
1. The Solution contains a snake, which begins asleep. -- OPTIONAL
2. The solution is a single player game. -- MANDATORY
3. snake wakes up when the player clicks it. -- OPTIONAL
4. The solutions uses the arrow keys to move: (relative to the player and the screen, not realtive to the snakes perceived POV) -- MANDATORY
5. The solution uses this color pattern: snake = green, background= dark grey, food = yellow -- OPTIONAL
6. the solution just begins the game on run. -- MANDATORY
7. game loses and exits if snake ever recontacts itself --MANDATORY
8. game wins if snake fills whole screen -- MANDATORY
9. the snake grows a finite set amount each time the snake contacts (eats) food on the screen. --MANDATORY
10. snake game must have a hard set window size, 640x480 -- OPTIONAL
11. On wake up, snake shakes a little, then begins moving forward, beginning the game -- OPTIONAL
12. On game win, show a victory screen then exit --OPTIONAL
13. On game loss, show loss screen then exit --OPTIONAL
14. The solution must be a console app -- MANDATORY
15. The solution must be winnable -- MANDATORY
16. Snake body follows exact path of snake head -- MANDATORY
17. Snake body growth always happens at the rear-most part of the snake. -- MANDATORY
18. the solution must handle non arrowkey keystrokes by doing nothing. -- MANDATORY
19. The snake spawns in the corner of the grid, facing up. -- MANDATORY
20. Food spawns at a random unoccupied cell (not on the snake, not on other food). Random selection must be uniformly distributed across all eligible cells. -- MANDATORY
21. The snake's initial length is 5 tiles. -- MANDATORY
22. The snake head has a distinct sprite/visual that differentiates it from the body segments. Body segments are plain green tiles; the head has a unique appearance (e.g., eyes, different shade, directional indicator). -- OPTIONAL
23. The grid is tile-based. Cell size is 20x20 pixels, giving a 32x24 grid (768 total cells) at the 640x480 window size. -- MANDATORY
24. The snake moves continuously at a "current" tick rate. Movement is automatic and constant; the snake does not wait for input to advance. -- MANDATORY
25. The snake gets gradually faster as it grows longer. Speed increase must have a floor (minimum tick interval) so the game remains playable. -- MANDATORY
26. Pressing the arrow key opposite to the snake's current direction (e.g., Down while moving Up) is silently ignored. The snake must not be able to reverse directly into itself. -- MANDATORY
27. The game buffers at most 1 pending direction change between ticks. If multiple keys are pressed between ticks, only the first valid one is kept. -- MANDATORY
28. Game loses and exits if the snake's head moves outside the grid boundary (hits a wall). The snake does NOT wrap around screen edges. -- MANDATORY
29. Exactly 2 food items are on the grid at all times. When one is eaten, a replacement spawns immediately. Exception: if only 1 empty cell remains, only 1 food exists. -- MANDATORY
30. The snake grows by exactly 1 tile per food eaten. -- MANDATORY
31. Growth is applied on the same tick the food is eaten (tail does not retract that tick). -- MANDATORY
32. Collision detection (self and wall) is checked AFTER the snake moves each tick. -- MANDATORY
33. A score is displayed on screen during gameplay (e.g., count of food eaten or snake length). -- OPTIONAL
34. Win and loss screens wait for any keypress before the application exits. -- OPTIONAL
35. The terminal cursor must be hidden during gameplay. -- OPTIONAL
36. The initial 2 food items spawn when gameplay begins (after wake-up if wake-up is implemented, otherwise on run). -- MANDATORY
37. The snake body is stored as an ordered list of cell coordinates. Each tick, the new head position is prepended; if no growth, the tail is removed. -- MANDATORY
38. The application exits with return code 0 on both win and loss. -- OPTIONAL
39. The solution must be written in C#. -- MANDATORY
40. The starting tick rate is slow and beginner-friendly: approximately 5 ticks per second (200ms per tick). Speed increases gradually — every 30 cells of growth, the tick interval decreases by 10ms. Minimum tick interval floor is 80ms (12.5 ticks/sec). -- MANDATORY
41. The grid boundary IS the window edge. There is no separately drawn border/wall graphic. The window itself is the boundary, and its size is locked by the program so it cannot be resized. -- MANDATORY
42. Only changed cells are redrawn each tick (dirty-cell rendering). The entire grid is NOT re-rendered every frame. -- MANDATORY
43. The wake-up click (requirement 3) must land on one of the snake's occupied cells to trigger. Clicks elsewhere are ignored. -- OPTIONAL
44. There is no pause feature. The game runs continuously from wake-up until win or loss. -- MANDATORY
45. Console character representation: body segments = solid block character (█), food = a distinct character (e.g., ● or ◆), empty cells = space. Head rendering should approximate a rounded, wider shape using appropriate characters or character combinations. -- OPTIONAL
46. The score display area must not reduce the playable grid size. If placed above/below the grid, the window accounts for the extra row(s). -- MANDATORY
47. Mouse input is only used for the wake-up click (requirement 3). During gameplay, mouse input is ignored entirely. -- OPTIONAL
